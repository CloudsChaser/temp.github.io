        		<h1>Hi, I'm Jeong.</h1>
				<p> As a Presales team member at a CDN solutions leader and a managed service provider, I have been responsible for collecting, processing, and visualizing the necessary information for IT infrastructure proposals, catering to customers' needs for migrating workloads into the public cloud, implementing backup solutions, virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI), and disaster recovery (DR) for critical services. My experience extends to English communication, where I regularly write reports to Microsoft and its customers. This experience aligns closely with the responsibility of understanding customer IT/Security infrastructure and business requirements. <a href="/about">Read more about my life...</a></p>
